Some info about the wedding and some of the weird etiquette that weddings usually involve.

# Gifts
Please don't give us any gifts or donations. We're ok there, we just want to be with our friends and family and have a good time. 

# Dress code
There is no dress code.  

Wear what makes you comfortable, if that happens to be a suit, that's fine - if it's anything else, that's fine too.
